ca-certificates-java (20110425) unstable; urgency=low

  The package will add a prefix 'debian:' to the aliases in the keystore from
  now on. Old entries will be removed during the update but other local
  changes will be kept. A backup of the old keystore can be found in
  /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts.dpkg-old.
